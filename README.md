# String-Matching-DNA-
An Algorithmic approach to search for given string patterns of queries (DNA Subsequences) from a given database (DNA sequences).

Test data

1.Test data contains in dnadata.txt and querybase.txt for DNA database texts and Query patterns respectively.

2.Just running question2.py would create the output text file which will be named as output.txt as well as the results will be printed on the screen since both file writing and printing functions are included in the code.

3.If you want to text data, just add texts and patterns to dnadata.txt and querybase.txt files respectively. If you want to add a title for a text or a pattern for ease of identification, just add a ‘>’ character at the beginning of a title. It will then separate data from it title and match the pattern successfully.
